| Test Participants | Annotation Creator, Archive, Viewer                     |
| Test Driver       | Viewer                                                  |
| Multiplicity      | Once for each combination of Annotation object, Archive |

## Purpose
The Annotation Viewer creates a screen recording with a narrative to show how the
Viewer software renders the Annotation objects created by the Archive Creator
as stored on an Archive.

From the view point of the Viewer system, the Annotation Creators have created M total Annotation objects and have stored these to N total Archive systems.
For completeness, the Viewer will complete M x N instances of this test, one for each
of the Annotation / Archive combinations.

As you read the instructions, you will see that we will allow combined screen recordings
to reduce the burden of managing multiple sessions and digital recording files.

NB: The recordings are intended to be viewed by the Test Manager and Subject Matter Experts. The recordings will not be distributedd to other participants or publicly after testing.

## Evidence Required
1. Digital recordings that are viewable on Mac or Microsoft Windows systems that shows a user navigating through the Annotation objects submitted by Annotation Creators.

## Procedure
The Annotation Viewer is responsible for obtaining configuration from the Archive systems.
The Test Manager will provide the list of WSI data and Annotation objects to be rendered.
The Test Manager will also provide metadata spreadsheets and rendering documentation supplied by the Annotation Creator systems.

This procedure is written as if the Annotation Viewer was running a single test with one slide image and one Annotation object that have been stored on one Archive. This would yield one digital recording of the rendering process described below.
For the sake of efficiency, we image that the Annotation Viewer might make one recording session that covers one Archive system and multiple Annotation objects.
Use common sense for this tedious task and provide enough information for the Test Manager to interpret the digital recording.

1. Review the metadata and other material provided by the Annotation Creator. In addition to identifying the slide / annotation metadata, you will be required to render each of the areas of interest designated by the Annotation Creator.
2. Create a slide (Power Point, etc.) with a large font that identifies the WSI data, Annotation Object and Archive that is to be tested. Include this information on the slide:
   - Annotation Creator
   - Slide Identity
   - Annotation Identity
   - Number of Regions of Interest Identified by the Annotation Creator
   - Number of Pyramid Levels in the WSI data
   - Archive System
3. Create a video recording of your screen while you follow these steps:
   - Show the slide referenced above
   - Read the slide information as part of the recording
   - Display the screen capture provided by the Annotation Creator that shows the geometric objects at a low level of zoom. The goal is that we can see all of the areas of interest that have been labeled by the Annotation Creator. In this recording, we do not expect to see great detail.
   - Render the slide at the lowest zoom level. The goal is that the user should be able to see the entire slide on the display. There should be some likeness to the rendering provided by the Annotation Creator.
   - Navigate to the first area of interest at this lowest level of zoom. State the index number provided by the Annotation Creator so we understand your intention. Zoom slowly through the image while trying to stay in the area of interest. Pan left, right, up, down such that the contents of the screen have to be replaced. Return to the original area of interest. *This may be difficult if there are not obvious landmarks in the image.* The goal is to zoom through every pyramid file and see that the Annotation geometric objects are faithfully rendered in a way that is *subjectively* useful to a human observer. Provide any comments that you think are relevant to help the Test Manager understand the navigation and rendering process.
   - Zoom back out to the lowest level of zoom, navigate to the next area of interest, state the index number provided by the Annotation Creator, and repeat the zoom process described above.
