# Participant Registration / Surveys

Each participating organization needs to complete a registration form to enable communication
and to understand the roles that organization will test. 
See the next section for the items that will be requested in the registration form.

## Registration Form Questions

1. Organization Name (as it will appear on marketing material)
2. Technical Contact Name
3. Technical Contact Email Address
4. Technical Contact Location: City, Country or Timezone (helps when planning email or discussions)
5. Please indicate the role or roles your system will play during the Connectathon
   - Archive
   - Viewer
   - Annotation Creator
   - Annotation User
6. Has your organization participated in a previous Pathology Connectathon using your proposed hardware / software solution? If you have used an earlier version but the underlying technology is the same, answer Yes. We want to understand if you have any previous testing experience with this group.
7. Enter name / email address for staff to be added to Connectathon email list.

## Survey Questions
The survey questions are needed to ensure that the Annotation Creator creates annotations that are understood by the Viewer and Annotation User systems.

### Archive
There are no question specific to the archive.

### Annotation Creator

1. Indicate (Yes/No) which of the graphical objects will be produced by your system. Provide an honest assessment and do not include stretch goals that you might drop.
   - Points (Single group sequence)
   - Polylines (Single group sequence)
   - Polygons (Single group sequence)
   - Ellipses (Single group sequence)
   - Rectangles (Single group sequence)
2. Please indicate which of these apply to the Annotation instances your system will create:
   - We will create instances that contain a single type of graphical object.
   - We will create instances that contain two or more types of graphical objects.
3. Given the source image set that you will supply, will your system produce Annotations in one Annotation instance that apply to all optical paths in the slide?
4. Given the source image set that you will supply, will your system produce Annotations in one Annotation instance that apply to only a specific optical path or paths?
5. Given the source image set that you will supply, will your system produce Annotations in one Annotation instance that apply to the full thickness of the slide?
6. Given the source image set that you will supply, will your system produce Annotations in one Annotation instance that apply to a single Z-plane?

### Viewer

1. Indicate (Yes/No) which of the graphical objects will be rendered by your system. Provide an honest assessment and do not include stretch goals that you might drop.
   - Points (Single group sequence)
   - Polylines (Single group sequence)
   - Polygons (Single group sequence)
   - Ellipses (Single group sequence)
   - Rectangles (Single group sequence)
2. Describe any limitations on the combinations of graphical objects in one Annotation instance that your system can render. For example, even if you support different graphical objects, are you limited to a single type in one Annotation object? Do you support only certain combinations of graphical options?
3. Describe any limitations on the number of Annotations in one Annotation instance imposed by your software. We assume these would be practical limits and not hard coded limits.
4. Will your system render Annotations that appliy to all optical paths in an image?
5. Will your system render Annotations that apply only to specified optical path(s)? This implies the software does not render the Annotations for other optical paths.
6. Will your system render Annotations that apply to the full thickness of the slide?
7. Will your system render Annotations that apply only to the specified Z plane. This imples the software does not render annotations for other Z planes.


## Annotation User

1. Indicate (Yes/No) which of the graphical objects will be used by your system. Provide an honest assessment and do not include stretch goals that you might drop.
   - Points (Single group sequence)

   - Rectangles (Single group sequence)
