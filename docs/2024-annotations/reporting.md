## Project Manager Worksheets

The Project Manager needs to maintain a record of results to serve as both a worklist of tasks to complete and as documentation for publishing finals results. The file [Project Manager Worksheets](./Project_Manager_Worksheets.xlsx) is a draft of what the Project Manager will likely use. Without describing the exact criteria for determining results, the notes below will guide interpretation.

### Creators Sheet
1. One sheet is created to record results for all Annotation Creators in the Connectathon.
2. Cells A3, A12 and A17 show how we identify the Annotation Creators. These could be real names or pseudonyms.
3. Rows 4-10 show that Creator A creates Annotation instances of different types when categorized by the geographic objects in the object. Row 4 indicates that one object will contain only Points. Row 9 indicates a different object that will contain Polygons and Ellipses (only). We could as easily label these as Creator A-Sample 1, etc. Rows 13-16 show that Creator B provides fewer examples. Row 18 shows that Creator C provides a single object.
4. Column C records that the objects submitted by the Creator passed testing with a conformance tool. The checkmark style and the fact that column C2 contains "Creator" means that the Annotation Creator is responsible for running the tool and reporting the result to the Project Manager. Cells D9 and D18 have an XXX-nnn value. These indicate the samples did not pass the conformance test and link to an item in a defect tracker. (We will likely use GitHub for the defect tracker.)
5. Columns D and E refer to items that are provided by the Creator to the Project Manager to be shared with other participants. These include Metadata and Narrative information (Column D) and Visual Evidence such as screen captures of rendered annotations (Column E). The green check marks indicate the Project Manager is resonsible for evaluating this material.
6. Columns F-I are in the context of one archive (Archive X).
   - Column F indicates the objects were placed in the archive using STOW-RS. The Archive system will attest to this.
   - Column G indicates the objects were placed in the archive using a Part 10 file upload. We prefer that participants use STOW-RS and would report only that column when appropriate.
   - Columns H and I are reported by the Project Manager who will use software tools to test the Archive as it responds to QIDO and WADO requets in the context of the various objects submitted by Creators. NB: Not clear if we will need to fill in every row in these columns. For the QIDO column, we might only need to fill in one row. We need to write the test criteria.
