# Viewer Tasks
These are instructions to complete Viewer tasks.


## V-104: Submit video evidence of rendered annotations
You will provide one or more video recordings that show your application rendering the annotations provided by the creators.
This includes performing the rendering steps for all Archive systems and all Annotations designated by the Project Manager.
The Project Manager will publish a list that is a subset of the Annotations that have been provided as a way to manage the testing effort.

You are welcome and encouraged to render Annotation Objects that are not on the smaller list.
Should you find any issues, please report them to the Project Manager.

The rendering will depend on your software and the annotations themselves.
Please start each sequence with a slide that shows the Archive / Annotation Pair to be tested. You can use the table at the end as a template.
