# Annotation Consumer Tasks
These are instructions to complete Annotation Consumer tasks.


## CON-103: Submit description of how your application will use annotations
The Project Manager will rely on this description to determine if your Annotation Consumer actor is using DICOM QIDO/WADO requests to retrieve Annotation Objects and is performing some non-viewing task with those objects.
It is difficult to predict those uses, and we need your input to determine how to evaluate your system.

This can be written in layman's terms and does not need low-level technical detail.
For example, you might state:
- Will use the annotations as input for training a detection model (understanding that there are not nearly enough samples to do this for real)
- Will calculate areas inside the closed shapes

You can submit this description directly by email.

## CON-104: Submit evidence demonstrating your use of annotations
The evidence you supply will depend on the use of the annotations.
This might take the form of screen captures, database dumps, video recordings, formatted reports, etc.

This task is tightly coupled to CON-103 where you describe your use of the Annotation Objects.
You might decide to schedule a call with the Project Manager to discuss options for this task and/or CON-103.

You can email the evidence to the Project Manager if the attachment or attachments or less than 1 MB total.
You can use this link [Dropbox upload link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/uu3fuuPy9hzJUAELLiWy) for uploading larger files if necessary.


## CON-107: Submit citation information for data submitted
To be described.
